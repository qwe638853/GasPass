# GasPass — Cross-Chain Auto Gas Card (ERC-3525 + Lit Vincent + Avail)

> “GasPass is like a cross-chain fuel card. It automatically refuels your wallet’s gas balance across chains — safely, seamlessly, and without friction.”

---

## Overview

**GasPass** is an **ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token (SFT)**-based "Cross-Chain Gas Prepaid Card" system.

Users can deposit **USDC / USDT** into a GasPass **Slot**, which represents their personal “gas account.”  
When the gas balance on a target chain falls below a defined threshold, GasPass automatically refuels it.

GasPass integrates:
- **Lit Protocol Vincent Agent** — a PKP-powered automation agent for decentralized EVM transaction signing.  
- **Avail Bridge & Execute** — intent-based cross-chain execution with gasless UX.  
- **Bungee Bridge API (Socket.tech)** — handles cross-chain swaps and refuels.  
- **Alchemy Gas Manager / EIP-7702** — enables gas sponsorship and account abstraction.  
- **EIP-712 / Permit2** — allows signature-based minting and deposits with zero gas.
