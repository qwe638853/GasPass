| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ERC-3525 Gas Slot**    | Each slot acts as a semi-fungible ‚Äúgas wallet‚Äù holding USDC/USDT for a specific chain. |
| **Permit-Based Minting** | Supports EIP-712 + ERC-20 Permit2 signatures for gasless onboarding.                   |
| **Vincent Agent (PKP)**  | Automated delegated execution powered by Lit Protocol‚Äôs Vincent Abilities.             |
| **Cross-Chain Refuel**   | Uses Avail‚Äôs Bridge & Execute and Bungee API for intent-based stablecoin transfers.    |
| **Alchemy Gas Manager**  | Sponsors or triggers gas top-ups via paymaster API.                                    |
| **Unified Slot Balance** | Slot states and refuel logs recorded on Avail for verifiable auditing.                 |

## üîÑ How It Works

1. User Deposit
Users deposit USDC into an ERC-3525 slot using MintWithSig.

2. Threshold Monitoring
The Vincent Agent (Lit PKP) monitors target chain gas balances.

3. Auto Refuel Trigger
When the balance drops below a set threshold, the agent triggers an Avail XCS intent.

4. Cross-Chain Execution
Avail executes through Bungee, bridging stablecoins securely.

5. Gas Top-Up
Alchemy Gas Manager or relayer converts bridged tokens to gas and funds the destination wallet.

6. Balance Sync
Updated balances and execution logs are stored on Avail.

### How GasPass Integrates with Vincent Agent


<img width="7290" height="3667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6c72a69-1e6b-4668-9b52-f26318086f8b" />


This sequence diagram illustrates how GasPass, Vincent Agent, and Bungee Bridge collaborate to perform secure, automated cross-chain gas refueling.

### üß© Process Overview

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Loop  
The **Monitor Service** continuously checks each user‚Äôs target-chain gas balance according to their on-chain `RefuelPolicy[tokenId][chainId]`.  
This is an **off-chain observation only** ‚Äî it cannot move funds or call contracts.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger Condition  
Once the wallet‚Äôs gas balance drops below the threshold, the monitor sends a **signal** to the **Vincent Agent** indicating that a refuel task is needed.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delegated Execution  
The **Vincent Agent (Lit PKP)**, operating under a **user-authorized Ability**, directly calls: 
autoRefuel(tokenId, inbox, req, expectedSorHash, targetChainId)on the **GasPass (ERC-3525)** contract.  
The Agent cannot act outside this Ability‚Äôs scope ‚Äî it‚Äôs cryptographically constrained by **user authorization**.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ On-Chain Enforcement  
Inside **GasPass**, the contract:

- Verifies the executor‚Äôs **PKP address** is in the authorized list.  
- Approves only the required amount of **USDC** for the **Bungee Inbox**.  
- Creates a cross-chain refuel request with strict limits (**spend cap**, **nonce**, and **expiry**).

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Chain Execution via Bungee  
The **Bungee Inbox** forwards the request to the **Bungee Gateway**, which bridges and swaps stablecoins into native gas.  
The **Destination Wallet** receives the gas directly, completing the automated top-up.

### üí° Why Vincent

In **GasPass**, all deposited **USDC** remains locked inside the **ERC-3525** contract rather than in the user‚Äôs wallet.  
An external ‚Äúwake-up‚Äù is still needed to execute `autoRefuel()` when thresholds are breached.

To maintain security, the backend **only signals** that a refuel task is needed ‚Äî it cannot execute it directly.  
All actual fund movement or contract interaction is performed **only through a Vincent Agent (Lit PKP)** acting within **user-authorized Abilities** ‚Äî predefined, cryptographically signed execution permissions that precisely define what functions the agent can call and under what conditions.

The contract recognizes the PKP‚Äôs address as an **authorized executor** only for those **whitelisted Abilities**.  
Even if the backend or the Vincent service is compromised, any out-of-scope call would fail due to **on-chain policy** and **signature verification**.

---

### üîê Key Properties

- **User-scoped authorization**  
  Every Ability is derived from explicit user consent and cannot exceed predefined function scopes.

- **Delegated execution**  
  The Vincent Agent executes only `autoRefuel()` or other approved functions within its authorized Ability.

- **Backend isolation**  
  The backend can only trigger the Vincent Agent; it cannot move funds or submit on-chain transactions itself.

- **Contract enforcement**  
  GasPass validates the executor address before allowing any operation.
